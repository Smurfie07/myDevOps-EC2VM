## Part 2: Creating VMs, Infra as a Code (IaC)
This part has 3 sub parts:
●	2a. Create two AWS EC2 instances (VMs), one for hosting the server container and another for hosting the client container.
 
●	2b. Configure the VPC and subnets appropriately to allow communication between the two EC2 instances. Use the t2.micro instance type, which is covered in the AWS free tier.
●	2c. Use Terraform for infrastructure automation. Place your Terraform scripts in the "terraform" directory of your client and server GitHub repositories.
